# Beach Spotter - Clicky Memory Game

* Train your memory to click each of the 12 beautiful beaches shown on the page only once!

* This app was built with React.js and deployed using Github Pages. The goal was to practice breaking up an application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
